<h2>About The Sitters</h2>
<br>
<p>Most of us have critters and need help with feedings, playtime, and walkies, and you can find a current list of all your local pet sitters who are ready to chip in.</p>

<p>This is all done by volunteers who love animals, and we just ask that you add yourself to the roster so you can take a turn helping out a furry neighbor. Walkers are ALWAYS needed!</p>

<p>From hampsters to scales, you'll find someone who'll love your pet reguardles of their species.</p>
